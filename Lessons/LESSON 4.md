##Lesson 4

###Introduction
In this lesson, students will implement code that actions lose conditions, or "Game Over", this includes detecting if Fla-Pi has collided with a pipe or if Fla-Pi has hit the edge of the stage. Code will also be included to allow the game to be restarted in-game without having to keep pressing the green flag.

###Learning Objectives
The main objective of this lesson is to deal with loss conditions in the game.

###Learning Outcomes

#####All students are able to

###Lesson Summary
Loss conditions are important in any competitive game, they allow the game to end and suitably be restarted without the need to close and reload the game. In Scratch, when we want a new game, rather than having to press the green flag, it would be great if we could handle this in-game to code a reset facility to allow us to start a new game with very little effort. In completing this lesson, we create and maintain a "Game Over" state.

###Starter
Show students the following video, ask them to consider what counts as a loss in the game, if they have played the game, ask them what happens when a game ends? Do they close the app and restart or can they start a new game easily?

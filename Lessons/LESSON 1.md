##Lesson 1

###Introduction
In this lesson, students will start to get the graphics moving on screen. At this stage there will be no scoring of points, dying or interaction between sprites, this session simply gets the bird moving up and down, and the pipe moving across the screen.

###Learning Objectives
The objective of this lesson is to understand what code needs to be added to the game in order for the sprites to move the way they need to in Fla-Pi Bird.

###Learning Outcomes

#####All Students Are Able To
Get the bird and the pipe moving the way illustrated.
#####Most Students Are Able To
Change the values so that the bird and the pipe move more quickly.

###Lesson Summary
The lesson will begin with a small discussion on copyright and plagiarism to ensure students understand the importance of crediting original sources when using it for their own purposes.Students will then begin to code a game in Scratch. The code illustrated in this lesson will allow students to successfully get sprites moving on the screen in the direction they need them to in order to fulfil the game.
###Starter
Place the word copyright on the board to provoke a discussion on what copyright is and what the implications of it are. You could then explain that cloning games has become commonplace due to the intricate nature of software law. You only need to look on the appstore for many different versions of seemingly the same game. Highlight that we are going to clone a well-known game, however they students should be aware of the laws around copyright and the consequences of plagiarising someone else’s work and simply passing it off as their creation. The original Flappy Bird game was written by Dong Nguyen and credit must go to him for providing the inspiration and motivation to reproduce a working clone to get students thinking computationally.
###Main Development
* Students will begin by opening scratch and deleting the cat sprite by right clicking on it and choosing delete.
* They will then choose new sprite and import both costumes for the Fla-Pi Bird. These can be found below:  
* Here is how to import graphics.

![Fla-Pi Bird Costume 2](https://github.com/AllenHeard/Fla-Pi-Bird/blob/master/Graphics/Flappy2.fw.png?raw=true)  

* Students will then import the 3 different costumes from the stage in the same way, these can be found below:

![Game Background](https://github.com/AllenHeard/Fla-Pi-Bird/blob/master/Graphics/Background.png?raw=true)  

* Next, the graphics for the pipes should be imported, there are nine of these, ensure students import all of these costumes for their pipe sprite.

![Pipe 2](https://github.com/AllenHeard/Fla-Pi-Bird/blob/master/Graphics/Pipes/Pipe2.png?raw=true) Pipe 2

![Pipe 6](https://github.com/AllenHeard/Fla-Pi-Bird/blob/master/Graphics/Pipes/Pipe6.png?raw=true) Pipe 6

![Pipe 9](https://github.com/AllenHeard/Fla-Pi-Bird/blob/master/Graphics/Pipes/Pipe9.png?raw=true) Pipe 9  

* Finally, the 'Game Over' graphic should be imported.

* Ok, so that’s the graphics in place, now we need to add some code to the individual elements so that they show at the right time at this very early stage of the game. Fist we will look at the

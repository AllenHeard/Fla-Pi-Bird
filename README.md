#Introduction
This sequence of lessons will guide you through the stages of creating your very own game called Fla-Pi Bird. You will begin by adding graphics before moving on to movement, variables, loops, and win lose conditions before finishing it all off with some cools sounds.  

##Computing Programme of Study Met 
**KS2**
 - Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output
 - Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs
 - Use technology safely, respectfully and responsibly; recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour.

##Resources
For this series of lessons, Scratch game saves are provided at various points to enable students to start at different stages. The game sounds and graphics are also included.
